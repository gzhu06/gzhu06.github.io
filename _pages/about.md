# About Me
* I am a Research Scientist/Engineer in the music group at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), where I focus on controllable and efficient music generation. I'm particuarly interested in generative models. My Adobe page is [here](https://research.adobe.com/person/ge-zhu/).
* I obtained my Ph.D. from [AIR lab](https://labsites.rochester.edu/air/index.html) in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](http://www.hajim.rochester.edu/ece/) at University or Rochester, supervised by Prof. [Zhiyao Duan](http://www2.ece.rochester.edu/~zduan/). My doctoral research centered on applying deep learning techniques to diverse audio applications. 
* Prior to my Ph.D., I completed my Master's degree in Acoustics from the Physics Department at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) where I specialized in acoustics and signal processing. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from [Kuang Yaming Honors School](https://dii.nju.edu.cn/kym_en/) at Nanjing University. 
* In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, particularly the electric guitar.
